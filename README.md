# StudentCourse-java-jdbc
This project is designed to manage student and course information in a database. It allows users to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on students and courses using Java's JDBC (Java Database Connectivity). The system connects to a MySQL database to store details like student IDs, names, course IDs, and course descriptions.
